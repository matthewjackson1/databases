> Explain in your own words when a database might be used. Explain when a text file might be used.

A database is often recommended as a solution for needs such as when:
- we need to allow multiple applications to access our data simultaneously, and want to maintain data integrity.
- we want to ensure data security
- we need to search a lot for data in our application.
- we want to persist information beyond the end of the program.

A text file may be used when you won't be writing much/any data to file from your application and there won't be any concurrency on the files. In these cases, flat file access can be an extremely fast and efficient option if you're able to load the whole file into memory.
